    <h1>Differences between Document and Window Objects</h1>
    <p>In this article, we will see the Document object & Window object, their various properties & methods, along with
        knowing their implementation & the differences between them.</p>
    <p><b>Document Object:</b> The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the
        document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. With the help of document objects, we can add
        dynamic content to our web page. The document object can be accessed with a <b>window.document</b> or just
        document.</p>
    <h4>Syntax:</h4>
    <p>document.property_name;</p>

    <p><b>Window Object:</b> The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. It represents a browser
        window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. Whenever a window appears on the screen to display
        the contents of the document, the window object is created.</p>
    <h4>Syntax:</h4>
    <p>window.property_name;</p>
    <h2>Some key differences between them:</h2>
