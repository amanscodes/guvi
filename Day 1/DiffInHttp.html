    <p>HTTP/1.1: For better understanding, let’s assume the situation when you make a request to the server for the
        geeksforgeeks.html page & server responds to you as a resource geeksforgeeks.html page. before sending the
        request and the response there is a TCP connection established between client & server. again you make a request
        to the server for image img.jpg & the server gives a response as an image img.jpg. the connection was not lost
        here after the first request because we add a keep-alive header which is the part of the request so there is an
        open connection between the server & client. there is a persistent connection which means several requests &
        responses are merged in a single connection. These are the drawbacks that lead to the creation of HTTP/2: The
        first problem is HTTP/1.1 transfer all the requests & responses in the plain text message form. The second one
        is head of line blocking in which TCP connection is blocked all other requests until the response does not
        receive. all the information related to the header file is repeated in every request.</p>

    <p>HTTP/2: HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol. HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual
        that converts all the messages in binary format. it works on fully multiplexed that is one TCP connection is
        used for multiple requests. HTTP/2 uses HPACK which is used to split data from header. it compresses the header.
        The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the client using the PUSH frame.</p>
